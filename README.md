## What It Is
The purpose of this assignment was to create a website built on popular design fundamentals...from the 1990's. We used the [Space Jam](https://www.spacejam.com/) website as our template and attempted to build a site that included the [following](https://creativemarket.com/blog/90s-web-designs):
- Repeating Patterned Backgrounds
- Animated and Patterned Navigation
- Too Much Text
- Skeumorphism
- Too Much Content 
- Looping and Overdone Animations
- Hit Counters
- Guestbooks
- Animated Cursors
- Adobe Flash

For my website, I chose to use my class notes as the content. 
## What I Used
- HTML
- CSS
## Challenges and Solutions
## Minimum Viable Product
The minimum viable product for this assignment was to build a single-page static website using web design principles from the 1990's. I chose to experiment with hyperlinks by building a separate page for each section of my notes.
